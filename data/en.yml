    Hi, I'm Luke, a Frontend Architect.

    I have 12 years of experience in frontend development and have a deep understanding of web frontend technologies, especially the React technology stack. In addition to my proficient development skills, I also have rich experience in architectural design and frontend engineering. I have led teams to complete the initialization development and refactoring of multiple medium and large projects, and achieved good results.

    In terms of backend development, I can proficiently use Node.js for backend development and have necessary knowledge of microservices and cloud native techs.

    Furthermore, I have unique insights into the technical construction of frontend teams and have brought considerable improvements to the company in member recruitment, engineering standard, and employee technical skills.

    Looking forward to the opportunity to cooperate with you!
